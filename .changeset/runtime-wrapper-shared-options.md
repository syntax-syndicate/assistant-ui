align the runtime wrapper hooks so every distribution forwards the same set of optional adapter-level fields to `useExternalStoreRuntime`. closes #4134.

`useChatRuntime` and `useAISDKRuntime` (which already accepted `suggestions`) gain three new options:

- `isDisabled`, disables the composer input entirely.
- `isSendDisabled`, keeps the input usable but makes `send()` a no-op (paired with `composer.canSend`).
- `unstable_capabilities`, per-thread capability overrides (currently `{ copy?: boolean }`).

`useLangGraphRuntime`, `useA2ARuntime`, `useAgUiRuntime`, `useAdkRuntime`, `useStreamRuntime`, `useOpenCodeRuntime` gain all four (the three above plus `suggestions`).

adapter-level additions, where missing:

- `useChatRuntime` / `useAISDKRuntime` already accepted `dictation` and `voice` through the `ExternalStoreAdapter` adapter shape; this just confirms the typing.
- `useLangGraphRuntime`, `useA2ARuntime`, `useAgUiRuntime`, `useAdkRuntime`, `useStreamRuntime`, `useOpenCodeRuntime` now accept `dictation` and `voice` in their `adapters` object and forward them through.
- `useOpenCodeRuntime` gains an `adapters` option for the first time (attachments / speech / dictation / voice / feedback).

every new field is optional and defaults to the prior behavior, so existing call sites need no changes.
