feat: the `"use generative"` compiler now understands generative-UI libraries. It splits every `defineGenerativeComponents({ ... })` call (dropping each component's `render` and its client-only imports from the server build, keeping `properties` on both), unwraps the marker like `defineToolkit`, and processes multiple `defineToolkit`/`defineGenerativeComponents` calls anywhere in the module. A toolkit entry that is a method call on a `new JSONGenerativeUI(...)` instance (e.g. `generative.present()`) now passes through untouched — the library routes its halves via export conditions — while any other non-inline tool is still rejected.
