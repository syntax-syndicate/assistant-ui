feat: move the `defineToolkit` and `hitl` use-generative markers from `@assistant-ui/next` into `@assistant-ui/core/react`, so they ship once from every distribution (`@assistant-ui/react`, `@assistant-ui/react-native`, `@assistant-ui/react-ink`) and stay portable across build targets. Import them from `@assistant-ui/react` instead of `@assistant-ui/next`; they remain no-op markers stripped at build time by a `"use generative"` compiler.
